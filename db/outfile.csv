Our services begin at 9:30 and 11:15 am (summer service: at 10:15 am only), but we suggest you arrive early to fill out a guest card and get a name tag at the welcome table just inside the main entrance on 16th Street. There you can also ask questions about Unitarian Universalism, membership in our church, or anything else.

You can also ask an usher to help you with any special needs. We have large-print hymnals, and there is a sign language interpreter at the 11:15 service.

The service begins with a time for meditation, accompanied by an organ prelude. All are welcome to come to the front of the church to light a candle of joy, sorrow, or memory.

The service begins in earnest with a rousing processional hymn lead by the choir and a call to worship from the minister.",-77.0354925,All Souls,NW,DC,38.9263064,"Anyone and Everyone, Unitarian"

We are people with questions, seeking greater understanding of God's love for the world and the message God's son Jesus Christ sought to bring us. We welcome and need members of different backgrounds and experiences because each individual offers the entire congregation new insight and understanding of the Lord. We respect all who are willing to bring their questions and insights to share with the congregation, welcoming the way each seeker joins in enriching our journey of faith.

All of us, as God's children, have an important role to play in the congregation's collective understanding of our role as a Christian community in the world today. The Church of the Pilgrims depends on the questions and the service of all seekers to continue its mission.

There is but one requirement for membership in the Presbyterian Church (USA), and that is acceptance and public proclamation of Jesus Christ as one's Lord and Savior. There are no other rules to bar or restrict membership. All persons, regardless of race, gender, religious heritage, nationality, sexual orientation, political persuasion, economic status, educational level, or physical health and ability are welcome in the church, because while such divisions are drawn in the minds of humans, in the eyes of God, we are one. Just as God's love for us is unconditional, we are called to open our doors and our hearts unconditionally to all who seek God. Let there be no doubt in any mind: All means all.

The Church of the Pilgrims believes that its members have both the right and the obligation to use their God-given gifts in a way that benefits God's work on earth.

All members are asked to serve in ways that reflect their abilities, including giving of their time and energy to church activities, financial support of the church's work with tithes and offerings and, when called by the church, ordination as ministers, elders, or deacons. We believe it is up to each individual member to reflect prayerfully on what he or she is called to do in the church and then to act-or not act-based upon those reflections. Although we recognize that the community of faith affirms an individual's call to church leadership, we reject any regulation that prohibits service based upon race, gender, religious heritage, nationality, sexual orientation, political persuasion, economic status, educational level, or physical health or ability. A ll are welcomed into our congregation. All are called and expected to serve the church as guided by God and consistent with their capabilities. Please join us!
